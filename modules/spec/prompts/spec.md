## 1. Overview

### What & Why
[One clear paragraph: What this feature does and why it matters to the business. Include the core problem it solves and the value it delivers.]

### Target Users & Success Metrics
- **Users:** [Primary user persona/role who will use this]
- **Success Metrics:**
  - [Measurable outcome 1 - specific metric with target]
  - [Measurable outcome 2 - specific metric with target]
  - [Add more metrics only if truly distinct and valuable]

---

## 2. User Journey

### Primary Workflow: [Descriptive Name]
**When:** [Trigger - what initiates this workflow]

**Steps:**
1. User [specific action]
2. System [specific response/behavior]
3. User [specific action]
4. System [specific response/behavior]
[Continue with essential steps only - aim for 5-8 steps max]

**Success:** [What successful completion looks like for the user]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Key error scenario 1]: [How system handles it]
- [Key error scenario 2]: [How system handles it]
[Only include significant edge cases that affect the core workflow]

### [Extra Workflows - only if significantly different]
[Follow same structure but more concise - only include if it's a truly distinct user journey, not a variation]

---

[Focus on 5-10 core requirements that define the feature's essence]

### Out of Scope
* [What we're explicitly NOT doing in this iteration]
* [Commonly requested feature being deferred]
* [Functionality that belongs elsewhere]
